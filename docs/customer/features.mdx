# Features

Talksy provides a comprehensive set of features for building real-time AI assistant applications.

## Real-time Communication

Talksy uses WebSockets (Socket.IO) for low-latency, real-time communication between clients and the AI assistant. This enables:

- Instant responses from the AI
- Streaming responses for longer content
- Real-time session management
- Tool execution with immediate feedback

## AI Integration

Talksy features an abstraction layer that supports multiple AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: Integration with GPT models
- **Local LLMs**: Support for local language models
- **Custom Providers**: Easy integration with other AI services

The AI service handles:
- Conversation context management
- Response generation
- Streaming responses
- Error handling and retries

## Session Management

Each client connection gets a unique session that:

- Maintains conversation history
- Tracks message count and timestamps
- Handles disconnection and reconnection
- Expires after a configurable period (default: 15 minutes)
- Supports graceful disconnection with a 5-minute grace period

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: A new session is created when a client connects
2. **Active**: Session remains active during the conversation
3. **Disconnected**: Session is marked as disconnected when client leaves
4. **Grace Period**: Session remains available for reconnection (5 minutes)
5. **Expiration**: Session is cleaned up after TTL (15 minutes)

## Tool Execution

Talksy includes a powerful tool execution system that allows the AI to:

- Call external services and APIs
- Execute custom functions
- Retrieve real-time information
- Perform complex operations

### Tool Categories

Tools are organized into categories:
- **Information**: Tools that retrieve information (e.g., weather, news)
- **Utility**: Tools that perform utility functions (e.g., calculator, converter)
- **Integration**: Tools that integrate with external services (e.g., calendar, email)

### Creating Custom Tools

You can easily create custom tools by implementing the tool interface and registering them with the tool registry.

## Streaming Responses

Talksy supports streaming responses for:

- Faster initial response times
- Better user experience for longer content
- Real-time content generation
